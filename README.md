# Shell Scripting (Scheduled backup script)
The primary objective of this repository is to put into practice all the Shell scripting concepts that have been learned. By developing backup.sh, a scheduled backup script that runs daily and automatically detects and copies files modified in the last 24 hours, this serves as a hands-on application of fundamental Shell scripting principles.

Through this script, key concepts such as cron jobs, file manipulation, conditional statements, and looping structures are reinforced in a practical scenario. Additionally, we can emphasize about the importance of automation, system reliability, and efficient backup managementâ€”essential skills for system administrators and developers working in Unix/Linux environments.

This repository is a learning-driven initiative that consolidates scripting knowledge while implementing a useful real-world automation task.
